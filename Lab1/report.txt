Section 3.1: Golman-Hodgkin-Katz equation

• Calculate the membrane resting potential for the values in the table
above of ion specific permeabilities (P) and intracellular (Cin) and
extracellular (Cout) ion concentrations (in mol/l, “molar” designated
by M).

-67.45 mV

• Interchange the Cin with Cout for all ions and calculate resting
  potential again. How does it relate to the above?

67.45 mV

• What is the resting potential if only the K permeability is
  non-zero?

-93.14 mV

• What is the resting potential if only the Na permeability is non-zero?

56.0322 mV


Section 3.2: Golman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation

• What is Im at a Vm of –70mV and 0 mV? What is the dimension of Im?

Im(Vm = -70mV) = -0.003 mA because we are close to resting membrane potential

• Calculate the I-V relationship of the membrane for the same conditions as above (use GHK-I and step V from –80 to 80 mV in steps of 5 mV). Draw the I(V) curve.

Look at Figure: ghk_3_5.jpg

Section 4: Spherical membrane compartment

• What is Im at Vm = –50 mV?
• What is the total membrane conductance of the cell at –50 mV?
• Plot the time course of Vm!
• Estimate by inspection an approximate value of τm during these conditions.
• Plot the time course of Vm under these conditions. Verify that your
• dynamic value for the potential of the peak and the potential towards the end of the simulation approaches that calculated from GHK_V in section 3!
• What, if any, difference do you see between the whole cell and the spine head with regard to e.g. Im and Vm (t)?
